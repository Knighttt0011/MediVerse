RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Previously, we reported a decrease in infection-related 
mortality in kidney transplant recipients. Regarding patients treated with 
dialysis, it is unclear whether infection-related mortality is decreasing. 
Therefore, we investigated current time trends and specific causes of 
infection-related mortality over 2 decades in a large cohort of patients treated 
with dialysis.
STUDY DESIGN: A nationwide cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients starting kidney replacement therapy were 
identified through the Finnish Registry for Kidney Diseases. Follow-up continued 
until death of any cause, kidney transplantation, moving abroad, recovery of 
kidney function, loss of follow-up, or end of study.
EXPOSURE: Long-term kidney replacement therapy.
OUTCOME: Death due to infection.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Incidence rates, incidence rate ratios, and adjusted Cox 
regression hazard ratios for infection-related deaths were calculated by 
sub-cohorts consisting of patients whose kidney replacement therapy was started 
either 2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014, or 2015-2019. As sensitivity analyses, 
we studied infection-related mortality within 1 year of dialysis initiation and 
performed competing risk analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 9,671 adult patients started long-term dialysis from 2000 to 
2019. Infection-related deaths declined from 47 to 23 deaths per 1,000 
person-years over the four 5-year intervals from 2000-2004 to 2015-2019. The 
hazard ratio of a Cox model including identified risk factors was 0.49 (95% CI, 
0.39-0.62) for patients who started dialysis in 2015-2019 compared with those 
who started in 2000-2004. The most common specific causes of infection-related 
deaths were septicemia (38%), pulmonary infection (36%), and peritonitis (8%), 
whereas opportunistic infections rarely caused death.
LIMITATIONS: Death certificates may have low sensitivity for infectious 
diseases. Only one cause of death is available. Categories of infectious deaths 
may overlap.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk of dying due to infections has halved since the beginning of 
the millennium despite aging among patients treated with dialysis. The reason 
for this development requires further studies.

Plain Language Summary: Patients treated with dialysis experience a very 
significantly increased risk of dying from infection compared to the general 
population. This study evaluated current time trends and specific causes of 
infectious disease mortality in patients treated with dialysis in Finland from 
2000 to 2019 based on data from the national registry with complete coverage of 
the dialysis cohort. The risk of death from infection in maintenance dialysis in 
Finland has dropped by half since the 2000s, despite the aging and increased 
number of patients treated with dialysis. Sepsis, pneumonia, peritonitis, and 
common bacterial infections were the most frequent causes of infectious deaths 
in patients treated with dialysis. This period of study preceded the Covid-19 
pandemic and provides a baseline for future comparison.

BACKGROUND: Abdominal sepsis is a critical and high-risk condition in intensive 
care, characterized by diagnostic challenges, complex treatment, and high 
mortality. Non-specific symptoms and the difficulty of discriminating harmful 
bacteria from the normal flora complicate a timely diagnosis and treatment. 
Although timely interventions are crucial, the best timing of surgery remains 
uncertain, especially in unstable patients. Diagnostic markers like C-reactive 
protein, procalcitonin, and interleukins help guide diagnosis but often lack 
specificity of an abdominal focus. This study aims to identify possible 
additional markers for earlier detection of abdominal sepsis.
METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 47 sepsis patients at the day of 
sepsis diagnosis, and from 10 healthy controls. Patients were retrospectively 
categorized into those with abdominal (n=23) and those with non-abdominal (n=24) 
sepsis. Patient`s characteristics, clinical outcomes, physiological and 
laboratory parameters, and cytokine levels were assessed. Receiver operating 
characteristic curves and Spearman correlation analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Age and sex proportions were comparable across the sepsis groups, as 
were the chronic disease prevalence, the severity of illness and mortality 
rates. Patients with abdominal sepsis were more likely to undergo emergency 
surgeries. Pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-18 were elevated, 
as was the anti-inflammatory IL-10 in both sepsis cohorts compared to healthy 
controls. IL-18 was particularly associated with a more severe inflammatory 
response in non-abdominal sepsis. IL-18 levels below 1892.00 pg/mL showed 82.6% 
sensitivity and 56.5% specificity for identifying patients with abdominal 
sepsis, with a significant diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.68, p = 0.034). This 
suggests IL-18 as a useful additional moderate predictor for critical cases.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that IL-18, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-10 are 
increased in sepsis, while IL-18 may serve as an additional biomarker for 
distinguishing abdominal from non-abdominal sepsis.

Background and aim Preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) refers to the 
spontaneous rupture of fetal membranes before the onset of labor and prior to 37 
completed weeks of gestation. PPROM is associated with significant maternal and 
neonatal complications. Maternal risks include chorioamnionitis, abruptio 
placentae, and postpartum infections. Neonatal complications commonly observed 
are respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), neonatal sepsis, cerebral palsy, and 
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). This study aimed to evaluate and compare 
maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with PPROM treated with prophylactic 
antibiotics for seven days versus antibiotics administered until delivery. 
Materials and methods This comparative study included 110 pregnant women between 
26 weeks 0 days and 36 weeks six days of gestation. Participants were divided 
into the following two groups: group 1 received prophylactic antibiotics for 
seven days, and group 2 received antibiotics until delivery. Data collected 
included the duration of membrane rupture, types of antibiotics used, and 
various maternal and neonatal outcomes. Results A significantly lower incidence 
of persistent amniotic fluid leakage was observed in group 1 (31; 56.4%) 
compared to group 2 (45; 81.8%) (p<0.002). Continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP) support was not required in 41 (74.5%) of neonates in group 1 and 40 
(72.7%) in group 2. However, a significantly higher proportion of neonates in 
group 2 required high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) support compared to group 1 
(p=0.015). Additionally, a shorter neonatal hospital stay (one to three days) 
was more frequent in group 1 (29; 52.7%) than in group 2 (17; 30.9%) (p=0.048). 
Conclusion A seven-day course of prophylactic antibiotics in PPROM is as 
effective as continuous antibiotic therapy until delivery, with added benefits 
of reduced neonatal hospital stay and potentially fewer antibiotic-associated 
risks.

BACKGROUND: Bladder stones feature multifactorial aetiologies, including bladder 
outlet obstruction, metabolic or genetic disorders and environmental factors. 
Bladder calculi occur in approximately 5% of urinary system stones. In addition, 
giant urinary bladder stones are commonly observed in geriatric patients. This 
study aimed to compare and evaluate the outcomes of open cystolithotomy, 
percutaneous and transurethral cystolithotripsy techniques in the surgical 
treatment of bladder stones in geriatric patients.
METHODS: The primary observation metrics comprised stone clearance rate and 
symptom resolution, and the secondary metrics included complications and 
recovery time. This study aimed to identify the most suitable technique for this 
patient group. The medical records of patients who underwent bladder stone 
surgery between January 2010 and January 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. 
Geriatric patients aged 65 years and older who had undergone bladder stone 
surgery were included in this work.
RESULTS: Of the patients, 72 were male, and 4 were female, with a mean age of 
72.6 years (range: 65-89). The average stone size was 39.7 × 29.4 mm. Surgical 
procedures consisted of open suprapubic cystolithotomy in 31 patients, 
percutaneous cystolithotripsy in 17 patients and transurethral cystolithotripsy 
in 28 patients. The stone-free rates were 85.7% for the transurethral 
cystolithotripsy group and 100% for the open cystolithotomy and percutaneous 
cystolithotripsy groups (p > 0.05). Symptom resolution occurred in 94.7% of 
cases. No statistically significant differences were observed in the 
complication rates among the three groups (p > 0.05), with early complications 
including haematuria (3.9%) and residual stones (2.6%) and late complications 
comprising fever (1.3%) and urethral stricture (1.3%). The mean hospital stay 
was 4.3 ± 2.1 days, with no significant differences among groups (p = 0.071). In 
addition, benign prostatic hyperplasia was present in 84% of male patients, and 
other conditions included ureteral stones (4 patients), a right-sided hydrocele 
(1 patient) and a vesicovaginal fistula (1 patient).
CONCLUSIONS: All three techniques-open cystolithotomy, percutaneous 
cystolithotripsy and transurethral cystolithotripsy-can be safely performed in 
the surgical treatment of bladder stones in geriatric patients. However, 
large-scale population studies are required to determine the optimal technique.

With an estimated prevalence of 2.5-5% of the western population, ingrown 
toenails are one of the most common nail diseases that leads patients to general 
physicians as well as to dermatological or surgical clinics. The cause of the 
disease is multifactorial, including genetic predisposition with a too wide nail 
plate, but also incorrect cutting of the nail and wearing of too tight shoes. 
Penetration of the sharp, lateral edge of the nail plate into the tissue results 
in inflammatory irritation of the lateral nail wall. The extent of the 
inflammation does not necessarily correlate with subjective symptoms, so that 
patients may describe severe pain even with low levels of inflammation. The big 
toe is most frequently affected. Several treatment approaches are available. 
Podiatric treatment such as tamponades or sulci protectors can improve the 
symptoms in mild cases. Surgical treatment primarily involves chemical 
matrixectomy (e.g., using phenol) or mechanical resection of the lateral matrix 
horn. The use of traumatic surgical techniques such as the so-called ""Emmert 
plasty"" or wedge excisions is not recommended.

Publisher: Mit einer geschätzten Prävalenz von 2,5–5 % der westlichen 
Gesamtbevölkerung stellt der eingewachsene Zehennagel eine der häufigsten 
Nagelerkrankungen dar, die Betroffene in dermatologische, aber auch 
allgemeinmedizinische oder chirurgische Praxen führt. Die Genese der Erkrankung 
ist multifaktoriell, hier spielen unter anderem die genetische Veranlagung mit 
einer zu breit angelegten Nagelplatte, fehlerhaftes Schneiden des Nagels und zu 
enges Schuhwerk eine Rolle. Das Eindringen der scharfen, seitlichen Kante der 
Nagelplatte in das Gewebe resultiert in einer entzündlichen Reizung des 
Nagelwalls. Dabei korreliert das Ausmaß der Entzündung nicht unbedingt mit 
subjektiven Beschwerden, sodass auch bei geringer Inflammation starke Schmerzen 
beschrieben werden. Am häufigsten ist der Großzehe betroffen. Es liegen mehrere 
Behandlungsansätze vor. Podologische Behandlung wie Entlastungsschnitt, 
Tamponaden oder Schienung können bei mildem Befund eine Linderung der Symptome 
bringen. Operativ wird primär eine chemische Verödung (z. B. mittels 
Phenolkaustik) oder eine mechanische Resektion des seitlichen Matrixhorns 
durchgeführt. Von der Anwendung traumatischer Operationstechniken 
(beispielsweise sog. „Emmert-Plastik“) wird abgeraten.

BACKGROUND: Ingrown toenails significantly impact quality of life. This study 
compares the clinical outcomes of the modified Winograd method versus partial 
resection with matrix electrocoagulation. We hypothesize that electrocoagulation 
will result in lower recurrence rates, shorter recovery times, and higher 
patient satisfaction compared to the modified Winograd method.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 132 patients who underwent surgery at our 
hospital between January 2016 and January 2023. The patients were divided into 
two groups: Group A (69 patients), who underwent the modified Winograd 
procedure, and Group B (63 patients), who received partial nail excision with 
matrix electrocoagulation. We compared recurrence rates, recovery times, patient 
satisfaction, types and frequencies of complications, and VAS pain scores. 
Statistical analysis was performed using the t-test and chi-square test.
RESULTS: Recurrence rates were 15% in Group A and 10% in Group B (p = 0.251). 
Infection rates were 10% in Group A and 8% in Group B (p = 0.459). The average 
recovery time was 11 days for Group A (range: 5-21 days) and 9 days for Group B 
(range: 5-20 days) (t = 2.81, p = 0.006). Postoperative VAS scores decreased 
significantly, with Group B showing a greater reduction in pain (t = 3.18, 
p = 0.002). Patient satisfaction was higher in Group B, though the difference 
was not statistically significant (Chi-square = 6.45, p = 0.091).
CONCLUSION: The modified Winograd method remains effective, with high 
satisfaction and low recurrence rates. However, partial nail resection with 
matrix electrocoagulation offers shorter recovery times and greater pain 
reduction.

INTRODUCTION: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a prevalent genetic cardiac 
condition characterized by myocardial thickening, poses unique challenges in 
trauma care. Sparse evidence seems to agree that HCM patients have worse 
outcomes following non-cardiac surgeries, particularly emergent procedures. 
However, despite a prevalence of 1 in 500 in the US population, the intersection 
of HCM and Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) remains undiscussed in current 
literature.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old female with unknown past medical history 
presented as a level 2 trauma alert following a motor vehicle collision. Due to 
persistent hypotension and transient bradycardia in the trauma bay a further 
cardiologic evaluation was performed and found severe hypertrophic obstructive 
cardiomyopathy (HOCM).
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: We report a case of a polytrauma patient found to have 
severe HOCM as well as provide a review of the literature including 
pathophysiological considerations in the management of the trauma patient with 
HCM.
CONCLUSIONS: Caring for the trauma patient with HCM requires a multidisciplinary 
strategy that integrates advanced cardiac imaging and cautious hemodynamic 
management, underlining the necessity for heightened awareness.

Background: Cardiogenic shock is a life-threatening condition characterized by 
the failure of the heart to maintain adequate circulation, leading to 
multi-organ dysfunction. While it is most commonly associated with acute 
myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathies, cardiogenic shock can also arise in 
unusual settings, such as severe malnutrition in patients with anorexia nervosa, 
a psychiatric disorder characterized by extreme restriction of food intake. 
Methods: Here, we describe the management of three patients with anorexia 
nervosa and severe cardiogenic shock, who were treated in our cardiological 
intensive care unit between December 2022 and January 2025. Two patients were 
successfully resuscitated after experiencing cardiac arrest, and two required 
mechanical circulatory support, including Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane 
Oxygenation and microaxial flow pump. The patients presented with a range of 
complications including multi-organ failure and respiratory distress. Due to the 
fragile balance between intensive cardiac and nutritional management, as well as 
the comorbidity of chronic malnutrition, therapeutic decisions were made 
carefully, including cautious electrolyte management, targeted nutritional 
therapy, and the use of advanced circulatory support. Conclusions: The treatment 
approach and beneficious outcomes underline the necessity of a multidisciplinary 
strategy in managing these critically ill patients with complex, interwoven 
pathologies. Our experience suggests that early recognition of cardiogenic shock 
and timely intervention with mechanical circulatory support may significantly 
improve patient survival in this high-risk cohort. Careful management of 
nutritional therapy and supplementation of trace elements and vitamins is 
crucial.

Background: Cardiogenic shock (CS) is a life-threatening complication of 
ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and remains the leading cause of 
in-hospital mortality, with rates ranging from 5 to 10% despite advances in 
reperfusion strategies. Early identification and timely intervention are 
critical for improving outcomes. This study investigates the utility of machine 
learning (ML) models for predicting the risk of CS during the early phases of 
care-prehospital, emergency department (ED), and cardiology-on-call-with a focus 
on accurate triage and prioritization for urgent angiography. Results: In the 
prehospital phase, the Extra Trees classifier demonstrated the highest overall 
performance. It achieved an accuracy (ACC) of 0.9062, precision of 0.9078, 
recall of 0.9062, F1-score of 0.9061, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) 
of 0.8140, indicating both high predictive power and strong generalization. In 
the ED phase, the support vector machine model outperformed others with an ACC 
of 78.12%. During the cardiology-on-call phase, Random Forest showed the best 
performance with an ACC of 81.25% and consistent values across other metrics. 
Quadratic discriminant analysis showed consistent and generalizable performance 
across all early care stages. Key predictive features included the Killip class, 
ECG rhythm, creatinine, potassium, and markers of renal dysfunction-parameters 
readily available in routine emergency settings. The greatest clinical utility 
was observed in prehospital and ED phases, where ML models could support the 
early identification of critically ill patients and could prioritize coronary 
catheterization, especially important for centers with limited capacity for 
angiography. Conclusions: Machine learning-based predictive models offer a 
valuable tool for early risk stratification in STEMI patients at risk for 
cardiogenic shock. These findings support the implementation of ML-driven tools 
in early STEMI care pathways, potentially improving survival through faster and 
more accurate decision-making, especially in time-sensitive clinical 
environments.

We reported a case of portal vein pneumatosis caused by a nasojejunal nutrition 
tube that was successfully treated conservatively. This patient was discharged 
after 1 week of treatment with imipenem/cilastatin sodium for anti-infection, 
gastrointestinal decompression, fluid replacement, and pain relief, and the 
patient's abdominal pain was significantly relieved. The main pathogenesis of 
hepatic portal venous gas is as follows: (a) increased pressure in the digestive 
tract leading to gas entering the portal vein circulation through the intestinal 
wall and finally into the liver; (b) destruction of the intestinal mucosa 
causing the gas formed by intestinal bacteria to enter the portal vein system; 
and (c) diffusion of gas produced by bacteria in intraperitoneal abscesses or 
portal vein and mesentery, causing pyelitis. The successful treatment of this 
patient highlights that addressing physical factors, providing gastrointestinal 
decompression, and administering anti-infection therapy can aid in the 
management of such cases. Bacterial culture of gastric juice and drug 
sensitivity testing can guide effective anti-infection treatment.

BackgroundChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema display a 
chronic and progressive disease for the individual patient. The forced 
expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is declining with age as displayed in the 
Fletcher-Peto curve. Despite established benefits of bronchoscopic lung volume 
reduction (BLVR) using endobronchial valves (EBVs), long-term data suggest a 
gradual reduction in the magnitude of these benefits.PurposeThis study aimed to 
compare the rate of lung function change in emphysema patients undergoing BLVR 
versus those receiving conservative management, utilizing coarsened exact 
matching to ensure balanced baseline characteristics.Patients and MethodsIn this 
retrospective single center study data between 2015 and 2021 was analyzed. BLVR 
patients achieving significant volume reduction (≥563 mL) were matched to 
conservatively managed controls based on age, sex, BMI, and smoking history. 
Pulmonary function changes after successful BLVR with valves, including forced 
expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and residual volume (RV), were monitored 
and analyzed over a 3-year period.ResultsA total of 60 patients, evenly 
distributed between the two groups (30 each), were included in the analysis. 
Median FEV1 change was -0.063 L/year for BLVR patients and -0.066 L/year for 
controls. No statistically significant differences in annual FEV1 and RV changes 
were observed (-0.07 vs -0.08, p = 0.492; -0.07 vs -0.07, p = 0.569; -0.05 vs 
-0.04, p = 0.636 at follow-ups in years 1, 2, and 3, respectively for FEV1 and 
+0.20 vs +0.25, p = 0.643; +0.80 vs +0.65, p = 0.960; +1.0 vs +0.85, p = 0.963 
at follow-ups in years 1, 2, and 3, respectively for RV).ConclusionIn this 
matched cohort analysis, no significant differences in annual changes in FEV1 or 
RV progression were observed between patients after successful BLVR with valves 
and patients under conservative treatment. The results indicate that COPD 
progression is the main factor for the decline in functional improvement after 
successful BLVR with valves.

Major mutations of SERPINA1, the gene encoding alpha1-antitrypsin (A1AT), are 
known to cause severe emphysema. Our study aimed to investigate the role of 
major mutations modulating A1AT levels in several lung pathologies and control 
groups. Blood samples were collected from healthy non-smokers (N0 = 85), healthy 
smokers (N0 = 291), healthy ex-smokers (N0 = 127), smokers with chronic 
obstructive lung disease (COPD, N0 = 187), ex-smokers with COPD (N0 = 64), and 
patients with asthma (N0 = 194), interstitial lung disease (ILD) (N0 = 93), 
sarcoidosis (N0 = 30) and cystic fibrosis (N0 = 26). Clinical and respiratory 
parameters, A1AT levels, the extent of emphysema and comorbidities on low-dose 
CT scans were evaluated, and patients answered a smoking history and comorbidity 
questionnaire. A1AT single-nucleotide polymorphisms were determined for the S, 
Z, M2/M4, 0 and eQTL locations by SNP probes using real-time PCR. A1AT levels 
showed significant differences between cigarette smoke-induced and other lung 
diseases. Compared to controls, A1AT levels were found to be lower in 
sarcoidosis and increasingly higher in smokers and patients with COPD, ILD and 
CF, respectively. The presence and pattern of emphysema were found to influence 
A1AT levels: lower values were observed in COPD patients without emphysema, 
while higher values were observed in patients with central and panlobular 
emphysema. Antitrypsin levels increased with COPD GOLD stages and asthma GINA 
stages. Variable A1AT levels were also found in ILD subgroups. The distribution 
of variants at the S, Z, M2/M4 and 0 polymorphic sites and the eQTL location 
showed no significant differences between patient groups with impaired lung 
function, except for Z heterozygotes, which were prevalent in patients with 
severe asthma. The eQTL TT genotypes had higher A1AT levels and the occurrence 
of emphysema and/or bronchitis was increased. A1AT levels correlated with 
several clinical and respiratory parameters in pulmonary patients, while 
FEV1/FVC inversely correlated with levels of A1AT. Molar antielastase activity 
was increased in smokers and patients with lung diseases; however, in COPD, 
antielastase activity decreased. The most reduced antielastase activity could be 
found in CF. Certain genotypes were characterized by increased cardiovascular 
comorbidity scores and antitrypsin levels. Our data suggest that in addition to 
emphysema, A1AT may play an important role in the development of a wide variety 
of lung diseases and cardiovascular comorbidities. Further research is needed to 
clarify the role of A1AT and its regulation in lung pathologies.

Background/Objectives: Pancreatic neoplasms, including adenocarcinoma, 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs), intraductal papillary mucinous 
neoplasms (IPMNs), and high-grade cystic lesions, often require surgical 
resection as a form of curative treatment. However, comorbidities and high-risk 
features may preclude surgery. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency 
ablation (EUS-RFA) has emerged as a minimally invasive alternative with proven 
cytoreductive efficacy in solid tumors. This case series evaluates the safety 
and efficacy of EUS-RFA in patients with various unresectable, non-metastatic 
pancreatic neoplasms. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on eight 
patients who underwent EUS-RFA at our institutions between July 2021 and 
February 2025. All patients were deemed unsuitable surgical candidates due to 
comorbidities such as advanced age, cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency, 
and COPD or due to patient resistance to surgical intervention. EUS-RFA was 
performed using a 19-gauge RFA needle (Taewoong Corporation). Follow-up imaging 
was conducted 3 to 6 months after the completion of RFA treatment. Results: All 
eight patients demonstrated a good to excellent response in terms of tumor size 
reduction. The most notable response was observed in a patient with pNET, 
resulting in complete resolution from 15.6 × 12.0 mm to 0.0 × 0.0 mm after two 
RFA treatments. Other neoplasms, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 
intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), also demonstrated significant 
reductions. Mild post-procedure complications, including pancreatitis and 
abdominal pain, were noted in three cases. Conclusions: EUS-RFA is a promising 
alternative for managing unresectable pancreatic neoplasms in high-risk 
patients. Our findings support its use across various tumor types with favorable 
outcomes and minimal complications, reinforcing its role in expanding 
therapeutic options beyond surgery.

Background: Cardiogenic shock is a life-threatening condition characterized by 
the failure of the heart to maintain adequate circulation, leading to 
multi-organ dysfunction. While it is most commonly associated with acute 
myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathies, cardiogenic shock can also arise in 
unusual settings, such as severe malnutrition in patients with anorexia nervosa, 
a psychiatric disorder characterized by extreme restriction of food intake. 
Methods: Here, we describe the management of three patients with anorexia 
nervosa and severe cardiogenic shock, who were treated in our cardiological 
intensive care unit between December 2022 and January 2025. Two patients were 
successfully resuscitated after experiencing cardiac arrest, and two required 
mechanical circulatory support, including Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane 
Oxygenation and microaxial flow pump. The patients presented with a range of 
complications including multi-organ failure and respiratory distress. Due to the 
fragile balance between intensive cardiac and nutritional management, as well as 
the comorbidity of chronic malnutrition, therapeutic decisions were made 
carefully, including cautious electrolyte management, targeted nutritional 
therapy, and the use of advanced circulatory support. Conclusions: The treatment 
approach and beneficious outcomes underline the necessity of a multidisciplinary 
strategy in managing these critically ill patients with complex, interwoven 
pathologies. Our experience suggests that early recognition of cardiogenic shock 
and timely intervention with mechanical circulatory support may significantly 
improve patient survival in this high-risk cohort. Careful management of 
nutritional therapy and supplementation of trace elements and vitamins is 
crucial.

INTRODUCTION: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a relatively rare 
condition characterized by compression of the celiac artery and neural plexus by 
the median arcuate ligament. The definitive treatment is surgical division of 
the median arcuate ligament, which can be performed via open, laparoscopic, or 
retroperitoneoscopic surgery. In laparoscopic surgery, this approach commonly 
involves reaching the root of the celiac artery from the superior border of the 
pancreas to divide the median arcuate ligament. We herein report a case of MALS 
following gastrectomy, in which the median arcuate ligament was successfully 
divided using a laparoscopic approach from the inferior border of the pancreas.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old man who had undergone open distal gastrectomy 
and D2 lymph node dissection for gastric cancer 16 years prior presented to the 
emergency department with a chief complaint of sudden, severe epigastric pain. A 
thorough examination led to the diagnosis of acute cholangitis and pancreatitis 
due to retroperitoneal hematoma compression, for which percutaneous transhepatic 
cholangial drainage (PTCD) was performed. Additionally, MALS was identified and 
considered as the underlying cause of retroperitoneal hematoma. Conservative 
treatment resulted in hematoma shrinkage and improvement in cholangitis and 
pancreatitis, allowing the patient to be discharged. However, because of the 
possibility of symptom recurrence, the patient was referred to our department 
for surgical intervention. Given the history of gastrectomy, an approach from 
the superior border of the pancreas was deemed to be challenging. Instead, we 
accessed the root of the celiac artery from the inferior border of the pancreas, 
successfully dividing the median arcuate ligament and confirming the improved 
blood flow.
CONCLUSIONS: MALS is a rare condition for which a standardized surgical approach 
remains to be established. In cases of adhesions in the upper abdomen, an 
approach from the inferior border of the pancreas may be a viable option and 
could contribute to improved surgical outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a 
well-established treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), offering 
significant symptomatic relief. Although DBS is generally considered safe, it 
carries risks, including the potential for delayed complications such as 
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a rare case of a 67-year-old male with PD who 
developed delayed ICH after undergoing bilateral STN DBS. Initially, the patient 
showed no neurological deficits postoperatively, with imaging confirming correct 
lead placement and no signs of hemorrhage. However, on the second postoperative 
day, the patient developed sudden right-sided hemiparesis. A CT scan revealed 
ICH alongside the left lead. The hemorrhage was managed conservatively, and the 
patient underwent extensive physical therapy, leading to significant 
improvement. Over the next 2 weeks, the patient's condition improved, and 
follow-up CT scans showed complete resolution of the ICH. At this point, the 
left lead stimulation was initiated, further improving the patient's PD 
symptoms. This case illustrates the potential for delayed ICH following STN DBS, 
emphasizing the need for ongoing monitoring and individualized treatment 
strategies.
CONCLUSION: This case underscores the importance of vigilant postoperative 
monitoring and individualized management strategies in STN DBS patients. Early 
detection and appropriate management of complications such as ICH are crucial 
for minimizing risks and ensuring optimal patient outcomes. The potential for 
delayed complications highlights the need for continuous follow-up, even in the 
absence of immediate postoperative issues.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with malignancies and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) face 
heightened risks of cardiotoxicity from antitumor therapies, yet the interplay 
between diabetes, antitumor drugs, and atrial arrhythmias remains underexplored. 
This study investigates the incidence and risk factors of atrial arrhythmias in 
this high-risk population.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 171 patients with T2DM and 
malignancies receiving antitumor therapy at Zhejiang Hospital (January 
2022-January 2024) were analyzed. Serial 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were 
performed pre- and post-chemotherapy cycles to detect new-onset atrial 
arrhythmias. Multivariate Cox regression identified risk factors, adjusting for 
age, hypertension, renal function, and cardiac biomarkers (troponin I, 
NT-proBNP). Subgroup analyses stratified by tumor type, diabetes duration, and 
drug class were conducted.
RESULTS: Atrial arrhythmias occurred in 10.5% of patients (18/171), with a 
significantly higher incidence in diabetics versus non-diabetics (18.4% vs. 
4.2%, P=0.004). Advanced age (HR=10.25, 95% CI 1.01-104.56; P=0.049) and 
anthracycline use (HR=2.70, 95% CI 1.02-7.19; P=0.045) independently predicted 
arrhythmia risk. Diabetes duration ≥5 years (HR=2.85, 95% CI 1.22-6.70; P=0.016) 
and reduced eGFR (<60 mL/min/1.73m²; HR=2.58, 95% CI 1.04-6.39; P=0.039) further 
elevated risk. A synergistic interaction was observed between diabetes and 
anthracyclines (HR=3.95, 95% CI 1.58-9.85; P=0.002). Dynamic rises in NT-proBNP 
(≥50%) and troponin I (≥5 ng/L) emerged as strong predictors (HR=2.11 and 2.73, 
respectively; P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: T2DM significantly amplifies atrial arrhythmia risk in cancer 
patients receiving antitumor drugs, particularly anthracyclines. Age, ischemic 
heart disease, and biomarker trends are critical risk indicators. Proactive ECG 
and biomarker monitoring, coupled with cardio-oncology collaboration, are 
essential for mitigating arrhythmia-related morbidity.

INTRODUCTION: Cerebral vasospasm (VSP) following aneurysmal subarachnoid 
hemorrhage remains a major source of morbidity. The best rescue treatment option 
remains uncertain. Intraarterial (ia) Milrinone and Nimodipine were suggested as 
safe treatment options.
RESEARCH QUESTION: We aimed to evaluate the effect of repetitive endovascular 
intraarterial (ia) combined Milrinone and Nimodipine administration as rescue 
therapy for severe refractory cerebral VSP.
MATERIAL & METHODS: In this retrospective single center series, we included only 
patients with refractory VSP despite maximum standard conservative therapy. 
Inclusion criteria for endovascular rescue treatment were elevated transcranial 
Doppler (TCD) > 180 cm/s and/or significant clinical neurological deterioration. 
Patients received ia therapy with Nimodipine 2 mg followed by Milrinone 5 mg. 
Repetitive reinterventions were indicated in cases of refractory VSP. We 
evaluated pre- and direct posttreatment neurological status, mRS at final 
clinical follow-up, TCD values and measured the DSA pre-postinterventional 
vessel diameters.
RESULTS: 38 aSAH patients received ia therapy. Of those, 18 patients (47.4 %) 
received ≥3 interventions (average:3.4 ± 2.6; maximum:11). Immediate improvement 
of neurological deficits was seen in 31/38 patients (81.6 %). Overall mortality 
was low (3/38, 7.9 %). The clinical follow-up after 4 months showed persistent 
improvement in 24/38 patients (63.2 %) with good clinical outcomes (mRS ≤3). 
Immediate postinterventional angiographic improvement of vessel diameter was 
shown in 97,7 % (127/130) of all interventions. Neither severe cardiovascular 
nor reintervention-related adverse events were observed.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In this series repetitive ia interventions combining 
Milrinone and Nimodipine showed promising clinical results and low mortality for 
refractory VSP. Larger prospective randomized clinical trials are warranted.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD). Understanding CVD prevalence and risk factors in these 
populations is essential for improving outcomes. This study assesses CVD 
prevalence and associated risk factors among CKD and ESRD patients in India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2022 
to December 2023 at Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, India, including 800 
adult CKD stage 3 to 5 patients, with and without dialysis. Data collection 
involved patient interviews, medical record reviews, clinical exams, and 
biochemical assessments. Logistic regression analysis identified independent 
predictors of CVD.
RESULTS: Among participants, 35% had coronary artery disease, 27.5% had heart 
failure, 20% had arrhythmias, and 15% had cerebrovascular disease. CVD 
prevalence was higher in ESRD patients compared to CKD patients. Significant 
predictors included age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and ESRD status, 
with ESRD patients showing more than double the odds of developing CVD (OR 2.50, 
95% CI 1.85-3.40, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study reveals a high burden of CVD among CKD and ESRD patients 
in India, particularly in those with ESRD. Early identification and management 
of cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients are crucial to reducing the risk 
of complications.

Aortic stenosis intricacies beyond the valve: A bidirectional Mendelian 
randomization study.

Cai D(1), Liu J(1).

Author information:

China.

AIMS: Numerous observational studies have reported an association between 
calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) and an increased risk of other 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the potential causal association is 
uncertain.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was 
performed to confirm the causal association between CAVS and the risk of seven 
common CVDs. The meta-analysis was used to estimate the combined causal effect 
with multiple MR results. The MR analysis indicated that genetically predicted 
CAVS is associated with the increased risk of heart failure (odds ratio 
[OR] = 1.064; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.008, 1.123]; P = 0.025), 
large-artery stroke (OR = 1.256; 95% CI [1.112, 1.418]; P < 0.001), 
cardioembolic stroke (OR = 1.228; 95% CI [1.117, 1.349]; P < 0.001) and atrial 
fibrillation (OR = 1.100; 95% CI [1.061, 1.140]; P < 0.001) without 
heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Genetically predicted hypertension (FinnGen: 
OR = 1.170; 95% CI [1.055, 1.297]; P = 0.003 and UK Biobank: OR = 2.456; 95% CI: 
1.571, 3.840; P = 8.16 × 10-5) increased the risk of CAVS.
CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive MR study revealed the causal relationship 
between genetically predicted CAVS and the increased risk of various CVDs and 
the causal relationship between hypertension and CAVS risk. Given the harmful 
causal impact of CAVS on adverse cardiovascular events, it is crucial to 
prioritize the prevention and management of CVD in individuals with CAVS. Blood 
pressure management is an effective preventive intervention.

Heart failure is a major health issue that threatens life and health. Previous 
studies have shown that heart failure is the terminal stage of arrhythmia, 
dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myocardial 
infarction. The pathological mechanisms through which cardiovascular diseases 
result in heart failure include myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy, myocardial 
cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction, vascular remodeling and calcium 
dysregulation. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of heart failure 
remain elusive because of its complexity, hindering the development of 
intervention approaches for heart failure. The present study reviewed recent 
research progress on heart failure and provided references and strategies for 
the prevention and treatment of heart failure.

Background: Thermal ablation of centrally located liver tumors carries an 
increased risk of bile duct injury due to their proximity to the biliary tree. 
We aim to evaluate whether biliary cooling using a nasobiliary tube can 
effectively mitigate bile duct injury during the ablation process. Methods: We 
retrospectively analyzed the data of 322 patients who underwent thermal ablation 
at Dalin Tzu Chi Hospital from July 2020 to June 2023 and identified those who 
received prophylactic biliary cooling during thermal ablation for central liver 
tumors. Data including demographics, tumor characteristics, procedural details, 
and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Results: Among the 322 patients who 
underwent thermal ablation, 9 with central liver tumors received prophylactic 
biliary cooling. The median distance between the tumor and the central bile duct 
was 1 mm (range: 0-4 mm), the temperature of the cold normal saline was 4 °C, 
and the mean volume of normal saline infused was 150 mL (range: 100-200 mL). 
Complete ablation was achieved in all patients in a single session without any 
biliary injury. One patient developed acute cholangitis after ENBD placement, 
which resolved with antibiotic therapy. Conclusions: Biliary cooling with 4 °C 
cold saline through a nasobiliary tube can improve the safety and effectiveness 
of thermal ablation for central liver tumors.

Background/Objectives: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastrostomy 
(EUS-HGS) using a fully covered self-expandable metal stent (FCSEMS) is an 
alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for biliary 
drainage; however, FCSEMSs may cause intrahepatic bile duct (IHD) obstruction 
and cholangitis. In this study, we developed an FCSEMS with multiple self-made 
side holes at its tip and evaluated its safety and efficacy. Methods: This 
retrospective study included 100 patients who underwent EUS-HGS with FCSEMS 
placement between April 2022 and October 2023. Fifty patients received a 
conventional FCSEMS, and 50 received an FCSEMS with multiple self-made side 
holes. Technical and clinical success, residual contrast in the IHD, recurrent 
biliary obstruction (RBO), and adverse events (AEs) were then evaluated. The 
clinical success rates were 98% and 90% for the side hole and conventional FCEMS 
groups, respectively. The amount of residual contrast in the IHD was lower in 
the side hole group (0% vs. 12%, p = 0.027). RBO incidence was significantly 
lower in the side hole group (8% vs. 30%, p < 0.001), with migration as the 
primary cause in the conventional group. Early AEs, including segmental 
cholangitis, occurred only in the conventional group. During reintervention, all 
stents were safely removed. Conclusions: The FCSEMSs with multiple side holes 
reduced IHD occlusion and cholangitis, improving biliary drainage and safety. 
Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Hemoglobin SC disease (HbSC) is a sickle cell disease (SCD) that is considered 
to be mild compared to Hemoglobin SS (HbSS) disease. Both HbSS and HbSC can 
present with classic SCD complications such as hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive 
complications, functional aplenia, avascular necrosis, and cholelithiasis; 
however, HbSC generally has less severe and less frequent complications and can 
often be asymptomatic. As a result, HbSC is often underdiagnosed until a patient 
presents with a clinically significant complication. We present a case of newly 
diagnosed HbSC presenting with potentially life-threatening acute cholangitis 
due to choledocholithiasis. This case report serves to demonstrate that serious 
complications can occur in patients with HbSC. Additionally, early screening and 
diagnosis of HbSC in high-risk patients may allow for earlier treatment and 
potentially reduce the incidence of complications and increase patient quality 
of life.

Musculoskeletal Lymphoma: Imaging Features, Diagnosis, and Assessment of 
Treatment Response.

Sleeth CD(1), Moeller AR(1), Gaskin CM(1), Symanski JS(1), Davis KW(1), Kresse 
ME(1).

School of Medicine, 1215 Lee St, Charlottesville, VA 22903 (C.D.S., C.M.G., 
K.W.D., M.E.K.); and Department of Radiology, University of Wisconsin School of 
Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wis (A.R.M., J.S.S.).

Lymphoma, a diverse group of neoplasms, has been frequently refined in 
classification, with over 100 types identified by the World Health Organization 
in 2022. Lymphoma represents 5% of new malignancies in the United States, the 
risk factors of which include genetic predisposition, infections, and 
inflammatory conditions. Extranodal lymphoma, constituting 25%-40% of cases, 
uncommonly involves the musculoskeletal system, with diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma being the primary type. Bone lymphoma, classified as primary, primary 
multifocal, or secondary, predominantly affects the appendicular skeleton. 
Radiography and CT aid osseous evaluation and may reveal a lytic, sclerotic, 
mixed lytic and sclerotic, or near-normal appearance. MRI excels in soft-tissue 
and bone marrow assessment, and PET/CT plays a pivotal role in staging. 
Soft-tissue lymphoma, which involves various compartments, is best characterized 
with MRI, whereas US may be the modality first used for evaluation. Staging 
involves fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT, and treatment response is assessed 
through various imaging modalities. Skin involvement, commonly associated with 
primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is described through stages, with FDG PET 
aiding diagnosis. Transspatial lymphoma involves multiple contiguous spaces and 
is known in the head and neck but not well documented in the musculoskeletal 
system. The authors provide comprehensive insight into musculoskeletal lymphoma 
by highlighting imaging findings crucial for diagnosis, classification, staging, 
and assessment of treatment response. ©RSNA, 2025.

A 60-year-old female presented at our hospital with a mass in her left breast. 
Needle biopsy of the breast mass confirmed a diagnosis of invasive lobular 
carcinoma, and the patient underwent left mastectomy and axillary lymph node 
dissection. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and was started on 
continuous endocrine therapy. Three years post-surgery, she experienced 
recurrence of multiple bone metastases and received a combination of hormone 
therapy and selective cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 inhibitors. Therapeutic 
efficacy was poor, allowing bone metastases to spread. Four months 
post-recurrence, blood tests revealed moderate thrombocytopenia. Despite the 
switch to chemotherapy, the patient's platelet count did not recover. CT 
revealed splenomegaly, which was not present three months earlier. Bone marrow 
biopsy revealed severe myelofibrosis with infiltration of small dysplastic cells 
into dense fibrotic tissue. The patient developed microangiopathic hemolytic 
anemia, but DIC was not observed during the course of the disease. Ten months 
after recurrence, a brain metastasis was detected, and the patient died the 
following month.

MIB2-Mediated SUZ12 Ubiquitination Regulates Clonal Proliferation in Patients 
With Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria.

Secondary gene mutations are one of the main mechanisms underlying paroxysmal 
nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) clone proliferation. Our previous studies showed 
that SUZ12 participates in PNH clone proliferation by regulating H3K27me3. 
However, the mechanism underlying the SUZ12 function remains unclear. 
Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were used to identify SUZ12 
interacting proteins in PIGA-KO K562 cells. Furthermore, RNA-seq was used to 
explore the signalling pathways. Finally, colony formation assays, western 
blotting, and flow cytometry were performed to determine the proliferative 
ability of the cells. We identified 59 potential proteins that interact with 
SUZ12 and revealed a physical interaction between MIB2 and SUZ12 exclusively in 
the K562-KO cell line. Furthermore, we emphasise the vital involvement of the 
MIB/HERC and ZZ-type domains in the physical association between MIB2 and SUZ12. 
After MIB2 knockdown, SUZ12 protein decreased while the ubiquitination levels of 
SUZ12 were enhanced. Additionally, PRC2-related target genes were upregulated in 
the siMIB2 group. SUZ12 and H3K27me3 expression levels and cell proliferation 
significantly decreased after MIB2 knockdown, whereas cell apoptosis 
significantly increased. MIB2 protein levels are also elevated in patients with 
PNH. In conclusion, MIB2 affects the stability of the PRC2 complex by mediating 
SUZ12 ubiquitination, which in turn regulates PNH clone proliferation.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with poor 
prognosis in community-acquired and COVID-19 pneumonia. There is a paucity of 
reports on the cytokine release syndrome, also called cytokine storm in the 
Mexican population with pneumonia and COVID-19; therefore, our objective was to 
compare proinflammatory cytokine levels in Mexican patients without COVID-19 
(non-COVID-19) and those with moderate, severe, and critical COVID-19 pneumonia.
METHODS: This study included 30 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and 57 with 
COVID-19 pneumonia. Disease diagnosis and severity were determined using the 
radiographic pulmonary edema assessment (RALE) score. Quantification of IL-6, 
IL-10, and TNF-α was performed using multiplex immunoassays. A receiver 
operating characteristic curve was constructed to classify subjects with 
elevated cytokine levels. Logistic regression was used to find associations 
between elevated cytokine levels and the presence of COVID-19 pneumonia.
RESULTS: The severity classification of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was as 
follows: moderate (n = 20), severe (n = 19), and critical (n = 18). The 
proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly increased in 
COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 patients (p < 0.005), while TNF-α 
levels were lower in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. High 
levels of IL-6 and IL-10, adjusted for age, sex, the presence of comorbidities, 
and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), showed an elevated risk (OR IL-6 = 
4.02; OR IL-10 = 9.36) of presenting pneumonia and COVID-19 compared to 
pneumonia without COVID-19 in patients. Likewise, 61% of COVID-19 patients with 
elevated proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) had a fatal outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of both IL-6 and IL-10 are a differential risk 
factor for developing COVID-19 pneumonia. These elevated levels were more 
frequently observed in Mexican COVID-19 pneumonia patients who died at the onset 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important that they are monitored from initial 
diagnosis as they may be markers of a fatal outcome in severe and critical 
COVID-19 patients.

The largest universal immunization in history has occurred as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The developed COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to provide 
protection against severe forms of COVID-19 by inducing anti-spike neutralizing 
antibodies. It has been found that individuals who have not been vaccinated 
against COVID-19 were more likely to contract the virus during a period when the 
Delta variant was dominant, as compared to those who have received the complete 
dose of the vaccine, irrespective of the variant. However, there is no notable 
disparity in the likelihood of hospitalization, requirement for mechanical 
ventilation, or mortality between the two groups once infected. Nevertheless, 
those who are unvaccinated may require additional oxygen support. There are 
reports indicating unfavorable health effects, ranging from transient thyroid 
dysfunction to death following vaccination. In addition, some people are 
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection despite they have immunized with the 
COVID-19 vaccine. Given all these considerations, several key factors should be 
better understood and considered to enable us to even more successfully manage 
future pandemics breakthrough infections. The effectiveness of physical 
treatment methods, e.g., Low Dose Radiation Therapy (LDRT) should be compared to 
pharmacological treatments.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Inflammation plays a crucial role in pathological 
mechanisms in schizophrenia (SZ) and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 
but the impact of dual inflammation on SZs' clinical outcomes is poorly 
understood. This study aimed to investigate whether dual inflammation impacts 
acute phase outcomes in patients with schizophrenia comorbid with COVID-19 
(COVID-SZs).
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 114 SZs and 49 COVID-SZs were recruited for this study. 
Plasma samples were collected and analyzed for levels of routine blood and 
inflammatory cytokines from all the participants. Then clinical symptoms, 
cognitive performance, and functional assessments were conducted at recruitment. 
One-way analysis of covariance examined the differences in inflammatory 
cytokines and correlation analyses examined the relationship between 
inflammatory cytokines and clinical outcomes.
STUDY RESULTS: After controlling for age, gender, substance use status, and 
antipsychotic medications, levels of inflammatory cytokines increased in 
COVID-SZs groups compared to SZs groups. There were significantly higher total 
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and positive PANSS scores in 
COVID-SZs groups compared to SZs. As for cognitive performance, the COVID-SZs 
group had significantly worse performance in processing speed and attention than 
the SZs. The COVID-SZs group had significantly worse health status compared to 
the SZs. There were significantly different correlation patterns between the 
severity of psychiatric symptoms and inflammatory cytokines in COVID-SZs and SZs 
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that dual inflammation exacerbates the acute 
phase clinical outcome of COVID-SZs. Suggesting a combined anti-inflammatory 
drug or the use of potentially anti-inflammatory antipsychotics in the acute 
phase of treatment to mitigate central nervous system damage. Regular monitoring 
of inflammatory marker levels can help reduce the risk of fluctuating 
psychiatric symptoms in patients with schizophrenia caused by inflammatory 
storms.
